# README file

This file provides a brife descritiop of the concepts cover in this repository through a number of project tasks.

## Web Server

A web server is a system that uses multiple processes to handle incoming connections. Its main role is to store, process, and deliver requested information or webpages to end users.

## Child Process

A child process is a process created by another process (the parent process). This technique pertains to multitasking operating systems, and is sometimes called a subprocess or traditionally a subtask.

## Parent and Child Processes in Web Servers

Web servers often run with a master process (parent process) to accept incoming connections, and many child processes to handle the requests. The number of child processes that the parent process spawns is controlled by the StartServers configuration directive in the WebServerâ€™s configuration file.

## Main HTTP Requests

HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. The most commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

## What DNS Stands For

DNS stands for "Domain Name System".

## Main Role of DNS

The main function of DNS is to translate domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. DNS enables using easy-to-remember domain names instead of IP addresses for each website or server.
