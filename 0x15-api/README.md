### Bash Scripting Limitations
Bash scripting is powerful but it should not be used for:
- Complex application development where more robust programming languages are better suited.
- Cross-platform applications as Bash is native to Unix-based systems.
- Performance-intensive tasks since Bash scripts can be slower compared to compiled languages.

### API Overview
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules that allows different software entities to communicate with each other.

### REST API
A **REST (Representational State Transfer) API** is an API that adheres to the principles of RESTful architecture, using standard HTTP methods and stateless communication.

### Microservices
**Microservices** are a style of architecture where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

### CSV Format
The **CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format** is a simple file format used to store tabular data, where each line is a data record, and each record consists of one or more fields separated by commas.

### JSON Format
The **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format** is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

### Python Naming Conventions
#### Package and Module Names
- Lowercase with underscores to improve readability (e.g., `my_module`).

#### Class Names
- CapWords convention, also known as CamelCase (e.g., `MyClass`).

#### Variable Names
- Lowercase with underscores between words (e.g., `my_variable`).

#### Function Names
- Lowercase with underscores between words (e.g., `my_function`).

#### Constant Names
- Uppercase with underscores between words (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

#### Significance of CapWords or CamelCase
- In Python, CapWords or CamelCase is typically used for class names to indicate that they are templates from which objects can be created.
