# README

This readme provides a brief description of the concept covered in this directory, **Firewall**.

## Definition

A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. It establishes a barrier between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet.

## Types of Firewalls

Depending on where it is deployed and its purpose, a firewall can be delivered as a hardware appliance, as software, or software as a service (SaaS). There are five main types of firewalls depending upon their operational method:

1. Stateless or packet filtering firewall
2. Stateful inspection firewall
3. Circuit-level gateway
4. Application-level gateway
5. Next-generation firewall (NGFW)

## Software vs Hardware Firewalls

In general, a software firewall protects the host it runs on such as a computer or device, and a hardware firewall protects the network. For this reason, software firewalls are often referred to as “host firewalls” and hardware firewalls as “network firewalls.

## Conclusion

While firewalls are a crucial part of network security, it's important to remember that they are just one part of a comprehensive security strategy. Other measures, such as antivirus software, secure passwords, and regular software updates, are also necessary to protect against threats.
