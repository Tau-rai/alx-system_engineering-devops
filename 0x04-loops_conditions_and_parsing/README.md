# This is a README file for DevOps project on Loops, conditions and parsing


## Advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash` is that it makes your script more portable. The `env` command uses the system's `PATH` to find the `bash` command, which allows your script to run on systems where `bash` might not be in the same location.

## How to use while, until and for loops
In bash scripting, you can use `while`, `until`, and `for` loops to perform repetitive tasks. The `while` loop executes as long as a certain condition is true. The `until` loop executes until a certain condition is true. The `for` loop executes a sequence of commands for each item in a list.

## How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
In bash scripting, you can use `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case` statements to perform different actions based on different conditions. The `if` statement executes a set of commands if a certain condition is true. The `else` statement executes a set of commands if the `if` condition is false. The `elif` statement allows you to check multiple expressions for `true` and execute a block of code as soon as one condition is `true`.

## How to use the cut command
The `cut` command in Linux is a command for cutting out the sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output. It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character and delimiter. It can also be used to cut data from file formats like CSV.

## What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them
In bash, there are several operators used for file comparison, string comparison, and arithmetic comparison. For example, `-eq` checks if two numbers are equal, `-ne` checks if two numbers are not equal, `-gt` checks if one number is greater than another number, `-lt` checks if one number is less than another number, and so on.
