# README

This readme provides a brief explanation of the concepts covered in this directory.

## Network Basics

Networking is the practice of linking two or more computing devices together for the purpose of sharing data. It involves both software and hardware technologies. Effective networking is vital to managing information and resources in our connected world.

### Key Concepts

- **IP Address**: A unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
- **TCP/IP**: Stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
- **DNS**: The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

## Web Stack Debugging

Web stack debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues within a web stack, which is a compilation of software applications, often needed for web development, especially for developing and running complex sites and applications.

### Concepts

- **HTTP Status Codes**: These are standard response codes given by web site servers on the Internet. They help to identify the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource does not load properly.
- **Error Logs**: These are files that keep a registry of events, errors, or different messages occurring in the software's background. They are crucial for debugging.
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Most modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools, which can be used to dig into the website's elements and investigate problems.
