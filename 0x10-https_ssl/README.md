This following are brief explanations of the concepts covered in this directory.

## HTTPS and SSL

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an internet communication protocol that protects the integrity and confidentiality of data between the user's computer and the site. The main component that provides this security is SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

SSL has two main roles:

1. **Encryption**: SSL encrypts data that is transmitted over the network, which ensures that the data cannot be read by anyone other than the intended recipient. This is crucial for protecting sensitive information like credit card numbers or personal information.

2. **Authentication**: SSL provides authentication by using certificates. This ensures that the information is sent to the right server and not to an imposter trying to steal information.

## Purpose of Encrypting Traffic

Encrypting traffic serves the purpose of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data as it travels over the internet or other networks. When data is encrypted, it is transformed into a code that can only be accessed with the correct decryption key. This means that even if the data is intercepted during transmission, it cannot be read or altered without this key.

## SSL Termination

SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting SSL encrypted data at the server side, rather than at the client side. This is done to reduce the resource load on the server, as the process of encryption and decryption can be resource-intensive. After the data is decrypted at the termination point, it is then sent to the server in plain text.

SSL termination can occur at various points, such as at a load balancer. It's important to note that while SSL termination can improve performance, it should be used carefully, as transmitting data in plain text can expose it to new security risks if the internal network is not secure.
