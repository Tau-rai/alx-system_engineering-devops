# README

This document provides a high-level overview of the processes happening when you enter a URL in your browser and see the webpage displayed.

**1. Understanding the URL:**

* You enter a domain name (e.g., "[https://www.google.com](https://www.example.com)").
* The browser recognizes it needs to translate this name to an IP address for connection.

**2. DNS Lookup:**

* The browser checks its cache for recent translations (domain to IP).
* If not in cache, it queries your ISP's DNS server to find the IP address.
* If the ISP's server doesn't have it, a recursive search across other servers might occur.

**3. Connection and Request:**

* With the IP address, the browser establishes a connection to the web server using TCP/IP.
* The browser sends an HTTP request (e.g., GET request to retrieve a webpage) to the server.

**4. Server Processing:**

* The web server receives the request and retrieves the requested resource (static or dynamic content).
* This might involve application servers and databases for complex interactions.

**5. Secure Communication (HTTPS):**

* If "HTTPS" is present, the connection is secured using encryption (SSL) for data protection.

**6. Response and Rendering:**

* The server sends an HTTP response with the requested content and a status code (e.g., 200 OK).
* The browser receives the response, parses the content (e.g., HTML), fetches additional resources (images, stylesheets), and renders the webpage.

**Additional Components:**

* **Firewall:** Monitors and filters traffic for security.
* **Load Balancer:** Distributes workload across multiple web servers for high-traffic scenarios.
* **Web Server:** Stores website content and processes requests.
* **Application Server (optional):** Handles complex logic and database interactions.
* **Database (optional):** Stores and manages website information.
