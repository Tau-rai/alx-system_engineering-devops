# Web Infrastucture Design

This readme file explains the concepts covered in this repository.

## Network Basics

Network basics cover fundamental concepts of computer networking, including protocols, IP addressing, and communication between devices in a network.

## Server Concept

A server is a computer or software that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can handle various tasks, from file storage to hosting websites.

## Web Server Concept

A web server is a specialized server designed to deliver web pages and content to users. It processes HTTP requests and serves HTML, CSS, and other web files to users' browsers.

## DNS Concept

DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites using names like www.example.com instead of numerical IP addresses.

## Load Balancer Concept

A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization, prevent overload on a single server, and enhance the availability and reliability of a system.

## Monitoring Concept

Monitoring involves the continuous observation and collection of data related to the performance, health, and security of computer systems. It helps identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure system reliability.

## What is a Database

A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage and retrieval. It is commonly used to store and manage information in a systematic and scalable way.

## Web Server vs. App Server

A web server handles HTTP requests and serves static content, while an app server processes dynamic content, executes server-side code, and communicates with databases.

## DNS Record Types

DNS record types include A (IPv4 address), AAAA (IPv6 address), CNAME (canonical name), MX (mail exchange), and others. They specify how domain names should be mapped to IP addresses or other resources.

## Single Point of Failure

A single point of failure is a component in a system whose failure could lead to the entire system's failure. Redundancy and fault tolerance are strategies used to mitigate this risk.

## Avoiding Downtime when Deploying New Code

Techniques such as blue-green deployment, canary releases, and feature toggles help minimize downtime when deploying new code by gradually rolling out changes and allowing easy rollback if issues arise.

## High Availability Cluster (Active-Active/Active-Passive)

A high availability cluster involves multiple servers working together to ensure continuous operation. In an active-active setup, all servers handle traffic simultaneously, while in an active-passive setup, one server serves as a backup.

## What is HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP. It encrypts data transmitted between a user's browser and a website, enhancing security and protecting against potential eavesdropping.

## What is a Firewall

A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, filtering and blocking unauthorized access.
