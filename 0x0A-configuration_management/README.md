# README file

This document provides a brief explanation of some key concepts covered in this repository. The concepts are mostly related to Puppet, a widely used configuration management tool.

## Configuration Management

Configuration Management is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life.

## Puppet Resource Types

In Puppet, every resource (file, user, service, package, etc.) is associated with a resource type within the Puppet language. The resource type defines the kind of configuration it manages. The `file` resource type in Puppet manages files, including their content, ownership, and permissions. The `package` resource type manages software packages on the target system. It can install, uninstall, or update packages using various package managers, such as apt, yum, gem, pip, etc. The `service` resource type manages services on the target system. It can start, stop, restart, or reload services using various service providers, such as systemd, init, upstart, etc.

## Puppetâ€™s Declarative Language: Modeling Instead of Scripting

Puppet uses a declarative language for configuration management, which means you specify the desired end state rather than the steps to get there. This is often referred to as "modeling" the desired state, as opposed to "scripting" the steps to achieve that state.

## Puppet Lint

Puppet Lint is a tool that checks check Puppet manifests against the Puppet Labs style guide and alerts on any discrepancies. It helps ensure that the Puppet code is clean and follows the recommended best practices.
